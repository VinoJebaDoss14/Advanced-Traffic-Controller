# Advanced-Traffic-Controller
This project is a Verilog HDL-based Traffic Light Controller designed for a four-way intersection. It uses a Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage traffic signals efficiently, following the standard Green → Yellow → Red cycle for each direction.

The controller can operate in a time-based mode, where each signal has a fixed duration, and can be extended to support sensor-based operation for adaptive traffic flow. Optional features like pedestrian crossings and emergency vehicle prioritization can also be integrated to make the system smarter.

The design is written in Verilog, tested through simulation using ModelSim, and synthesized using Intel Quartus Prime.
